Human body monitor, muscle performance monitor, exersices recomendations, and preventive health.

Collaboration with Global Nominee #1 Starc Industries from Auckland New Zealand,they will use our web api and data to show vital statistics right on Astronaut's helmet

Special thanks to Start Industries for the interest shown and congrats for his awesome project Spaceglove: Spacecraft Gesture And Voice Commanding (https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/project/starc-industries)
