#This project's collaborates with Global Nominee #1 and winner Starc Industries from Auckland New Zealand
Special thanks to Start Industries for the interest shown and congrats for his awesome project Spaceglove: Spacecraft Gesture And Voice Commanding (https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/project/starc-industries)
They will use our web api and all recolected data to show vital statistics right on Astronaut's helmet (see simulation on pdf)

##Core Modules:
1.Medical Analysis (raw data shown as line charts and data tables, as well as illness preventive and corrective actions that can be taken)

2.Muscle Performance (giving advices, recomendations, exercises that can increase each different muscle region of the body)

3.Website & Mobile apps for monitoring this data recolected by the device thru its web api

4.Wearable for live monitoring while exercise (ECG, EMG)

5.Because of it useful web api there's already an Integration plan in cooperation with Stac Industries and his Spaceglove: Spacecraft Gesture And Voice Commanding project located @ https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/project/starc-industries/

##Body Scan
 	Body Temperature
 	Environment Temperature
 	Glucometer
 	Saliva PH level
 	ECG (electrocardiograph)
 	ECM (electromyograph)
 	Oximeter
 	Blood Pressure

##View Results
###Medical Analysis
Data tables with preventive and corrective alerts when abnormal levels are detected, show results on colors (green is fine, yellow is warning, red is problem), compare datasets (earth levels againts today's or first day in space), medical raw recomendations.

###Muscle Performance
Body map showing different muscle groups and they performance, muscle intensity data so the explorer can identify which group in particular requires extra workout, data comparassy charts (e.g.:earth performance against each different capture at any date in particular), exercises recomendations.
